KYC Module

Section 1: General Info
Subsection 1: Verification of Business Account

Merchants are ranked into 6 size categories, based on their transactions' volume (calculated daily)


KYC Process 
When a merchant is first introduced into our system, he defaults at level 4. The level can only go up as the merchant performs all sorts of transactions. The transactions volume calculates all incoming & outgoing transactions of the merchants under the category (Change Amount) and not transactions under the category Change Available (which includes Reserved & Unreserved transactions).

The Viva Wallet account won't be functional (will not instantly have an IBAN account, be enabled and customers will be able to transfer money, pay bills, use their card etc.) unless they verify their account. 

Important Note! 
We would like to inform you that the official information that will be given to customers concerning the timeframe that is needed for their account to be verified is 1 to 4 business days. 

When a FULLY verified customer requests to update their document with his/her new ID number, we need to raise the case to KYC Support. 

For internal use ONLY:

There will be some cases, where the verification process will be completed in 4 business days, instead of 3. The reason is that we may need to run some extra checks internally before verifying the merchant's account. Given this, we will advise all merchants from now on that the verification process will be completed in 1 to 4 business days.

In the event that you receive a query from a merchant with regards to the verification process, and when his account will be verified, keep in mind the below points: 

Advise the merchant to locate the review status of the documents submitted on his UI by following this path; (Settings>Profile>Verify Account)
At the same time, check the KYC Proof tabs on Dynamics (When the merchant contacted you via chat or E-Mail
In the event that there is a document that has been rejected, consult the merchant on what he needs to upload (check comments on KYC Proof tabs next to the rejected document) 
NOTE! In case that a customer asks to be informed on when his account will be verified, and you locate on KYC Proof tabs all documents marked as "Approved", PLEASE:

Ask the merchant when was the date he uploaded his LAST document (cross-check the information on KYC Proof tabs) / The 1 to 4 business days timeframe begins from the date that the LAST document has been uploaded. 
If all documents are approved and the merchant should have been verified, but does not have liquidation, i.e. the ability to transfer funds and the KYC status is "NO", advise him that he will receive an E-mail shortly to his registered E-mail address informing him about the completion of the verification process. DO NOT CONFIRM THAT ALL THE DOCUMENTS ARE APPROVED ONLY THAT THESE HAVE BEEN UPLOADED. You may use this macro "FIRST NAME, we need some more time so as to verify your account. All the necessary checks have not been completed and you will be informed about the result of the verification to your registered email address. 
IF more than 4 business days have passed, and the merchant's status is verified "NO", as well as liquidation status "NO", escalate the case to KYC Support. 

Merchant Size & KYC Level Relation
The following table includes the merchant size and the KYC levels and how they are related to each other.

NOTE: From 09/04/2021 the levels 1,2,3 are not applicable.
KYC REQUIREMENTS PER LEVEL  
KYC only CHECKS 	Level 4 and Level 6	and for a few countries Level 5

Identity & ID verification vendor 
 
Physical Documentation according to the legal form

Due Diligence

KYC Levels explained:
Level 1- NOT APPLICABLE 
Level 2- NOT APPLICABLE 
Level 3- NOT APPLICABLE 

Level 4

Merchant sees a feed item requesting him to verify his account.
He must upload the legal documents asked, depending on the legal form, to verify his account.
ID Check through ID check app

Pending Verification feed item (UI).

Viva Wallet account interface - ID verification steps
Step 1: The customer must use a device that has a camera to take live photo (selfie) of himself and of the document. If the device has a camera, the customer will see the following and can click "CONTINUE" (for messages in the supported languages please refer to ID Verification Messages: https://viva-wallet.document360.io/v1/docs/id-verification-messages).

If the device does not have a camera, the customer will be prompted to either connect a webcam or download the Viva Wallet app, in order to proceed.
Step 2: Customer starts the procedure. 
Step 3: Chooses the ID document they wish to upload.
Step 4: Must Take two photos of both sides of the document.
Step 5: When ID Verification is completed the customer is prompted to "Continue" with Face Verification.
The camera must be centered.
The customer must "Frame" his/her face in the center of the oval and select "Start".
If the face is not centered, the customer will see the following and be prompted to "Try Again".
Step 6: When the photo is taken correctly centered, an image quality check screen will appear.
The external vendor will proceed to the following checks and will provide an answer in minutes.
On Level 4 , the merchant must also upload legal documents depending on the legal form.
The KYC Policy per country and per legal form, is described in detail in this article:https://viva-wallet.document360.io/v1/docs/kyc-policy-per-country

KYC Ops proceed to evaluation and:

If checks ARE ok:

Proof Status: manually set to Approved.
Identification State: manually set to Verified.
IBAN feature is enabled.
Allow liquidation role is on.
If checks are NOT ok:

Proof Status: manually set to Rejected.
Verification status change to Pending.
Pending verification mail.
Pending verification feed item.
Account interface Feed item - Verification in progress.
Account interface Feed item – Pending verification.
Account interface Feed item – Successful verification.

Successful verification email.

Note! In Portugal, Spain, Germany and Austria the Verification of the ID Document is performed by Video ID and not ID check. During the process of Video ID, the customer must verify his ID through a video call with an agent.
This is a picture of what the customer sees before the start of the Video ID verification process.

For internal use: Once the verification of the documents by the KYC team is completed, the merchant's account is assigned to the AML team for audit, and AML gives the final approval for identification, therefore the account acquires IBAN and becomes fully operational.
Important! So in case of customer communication and after checking in the KYC Proofs field that all the required documents are "approved" and yet the customer's account does not have liquidation, i.e. the ability to transfer funds, then we check the processing date of the document from the "Last updated" field (see photo).

If 1 business day has passed since the most recent test date, then we proceed to escalation in the KYC team.
Ιf it has not passed we inform the customer that all the necessary checks have not been completed and he will be informed about the result of the identification in his registration email.
Level 5
The KYC level 5 is not applicable in most of the countries that Viva Wallet has presence. Merchants upload all the legal documents in the previous level - level 4. This article explains in detail the policy for each country per legal form/ per proof: KYC-POLICIES PER COUNTRY: https://viva-wallet.document360.io/v1/docs/kyc-policy-per-country
Level 6 
When the merchant enters KYC Level 6, then the following things happen:

Identification Level automatically changes to Level 6 and Identification State to IN PROGRESS.
Customer is not affected (no feed item, no notifications in account interface).
Allow Liquidation role is not affected.
KYC Department proceeds to  background checks and after that the following outcomes may occur:

If checks ARE ok:
Proof Status: manually set to Approved.
Identification Level: manually set to Level 6.
Identification State: manually set to Verified.
If checks are NOT ok:

Proof Status: manually set to Rejected.
Other actions depend on the findings and will be based on Risk Policy (terminate account etc.).
Troubleshooting steps
In case the upload of the KYC documents is NOT available to the customer, please consult the merchant to follow the below steps: 

Try to log in from another browser 
Delete Cookies 
Try to log in through VW app (the customer will be redirected to log in via their mobile browser)
Use an incognito window 
Try another device (laptop or mobile) 
He should need to upload at least one document and the ID check would need to be completed first, so as the "Submit" option to be enabled. 

Last but not least, there is a specific file size limit for each document. Each attached document should not exceed 8 MB and must be in the format pdf/jpg./png. and/or doc.

Subsection 2: KYC Proofs in CRM Dynamics

Display the KYC proofs that a client needs to provide in CRM Dynamics

Important! 
The verification process takes 1 to 4 business days from the date of the documents' submission.

The UBO data proofs will be automatically opened based on customer's self-declared data on the associated people screen of the registration form.

Rules for opening proofs

All stakeholders (natural persons) registered by the customer himself via the registration form when:

role = Shareholder AND shareholding percentage >= 25% (all countries)
role = Shareholder AND shareholding percentage > 25% (Portugal)
Exception: A UBO proof won't be opened when the natural person also holds the role of Authorized administrator (he is the person opening the account), since we do the KYC for him anyway. 

Note: In each proof opened, the First Name/Last name of the stakeholder will be added as a Comment by the system, so it will be displayed to the customer on the proof list.

1. Go to CRM Dynamics - Customer Service Hub  -> and from the search bar

find the Account you wish by using the company's VAT number or Registration number.

2. Once you find the Account select “KYC proofs”.

3. Inside this tab, you will see all the KYC proofs that are requested for the specific customer as well as their status. An explanation of each status can be found at the end of this section by scrolling down.

Common KYC Proof Types:

Proof of ID 
Proof of Tax ID 
Proof of Residence
Proof of Funds & Wealth
Proof of Business Establishment, Ownership & Representation
Economic Profile
ID Check
Residence Permit

KYC Proof Statuses:

Created: Shows that we have requested a specific proof/document
Validation Asked: Customer has uploaded a proof/document and it is being reviewed by our KYC department
Rejected: Document/Proof has been rejected by KYC
Approved: Document/Proof has been accepted by KYC
Expired: New Document/Proof must be uploaded with recent date
Postponed: Document/Proof can be uploaded at a later date

Subsection 3: Expired Documents - Automated Process

Viva Wallet is required to renew all expired documents previously submitted by its Customers, as well as renew specific documents for High Risk merchants & personal (GR) accounts annually

The workflow for both processes is the same:

1. One month before expiration (expiration = date of proof expiration OR date of annual review)

Specific Proofs are automatically set to status in "Expired" so the relevant slots will be opened in Selfcare.
Custom pinned feed item to notify the customer.

Custom e-mail to notify the customer.

Liquidation Role & Identification status are not affected at this point.

2. Date of expiration If the customer does not proceed to the renewal and upload of documents, the following things happen on the day of expiration/annual review:

Identification State is set to PENDING.
Default deed item for PENDING status.
Default e-mail for PENDING status.
Liquidation is not affected, but in case it is Enabled then we provide a grace period of 30 days.
3. End of grace period (30 days after expiration) If the customer does not proceed to the renewal of the documents within 30 days after the expiration, the following things happen:

Identification State remains PENDING.
Liquidation Role is removed.
Workflow disruption - submission of documents

If at any point during this workflow, user uploads the required documents and they are handled by KYC Ops manually then the workflow is interrupted. 

So, if on expiration day proof status is anything other than Expired (Approved, Postponed, Submitted, Rejected), then workflow is stopped.

Subsection 3: Expired Documents - Automated Process

Governments worldwide, within the context of combating tax evasion, improving tax transparency and protecting the reliability of the tax system, require financial institutions to collect tax information from their clients and report this information to relevant tax authorities of each country

Introduction FATCA/CRS 
New customers that register Viva Wallet and are obligated to FATCA/CRS
FATCA FORMS 
CRS FORMS
 Introduction FATCA/CRS 
The Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act, known as the FATCA, was imposed by the USA and came into force in July 2014. Its aim is to detect, deter and discourage offshore tax evasion by U.S. citizens or residents, who either directly or indirectly, invest outside the USA through foreign financial institutions.
Several countries, including Greece, signed an Intergovernmental Agreement with the USA (IGA), in order to facilitate the implementation of FATCA provisions by financial institutions in their jurisdictions.
The Common Reporting Standard, known as the CRS, was promoted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as an additional international initiative based on the development of a single global standard for the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities.
Several countries, including Greece, have adopted the CRS, with the number of participating countries constantly increasing.
FATCA - Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
FATCA is a regulatory framework, between the Government of the Hellenic Republic and the Government of the United States of America, according to it Greek financial institutions are obliged to identify as “US Persons” clients who are considered citizens or residents of the USA under the law, and to report annually specific information regarding the bank accounts of such clients to the Internal Revenue Service of the USA via the Greek Independent Authority for Public Revenue.
Law 4493/2017 ratified the Memorandum of Understanding and the Agreement between the Government of the Hellenic Republic and the Government of the United States of America on the improvement of international tax compliance and the application of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) aimed at preventing tax evasion.
For more information concerning the requirements of the FATCA, the customer may visit the website of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS): https://www.irs.gov/ or the website of the Independent Authority for Public Revenue, or consult his/her tax adviser.

FATCA tax compliance forms
The FATCA tax compliance forms can be found here FATCA/CRS | Viva Wallet Support: https://help.vivawallet.com/en/articles/5857106-fatca-crs
Example: If a customer has created a personal account in Viva Wallet and he/she has US citizenship, then he/she is obliged to FATCA and will be asked to upload (KYC proofs) the corresponding form either during the identification process or in the future.
In case the customer asks for further information regarding the forms that he/she should fill in, for example which he/she should fill or which fields he/she must fill, we should guide him to contact their tax advisor / accountant, the AADE or the local tax authority.
CRS - Common Reporting Standard (non US countries that participate CRS): https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/crs-mcaa-signatories.pdf
The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Council Directive EU/2014/107 DAC2 as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation aim to tackle tax evasion and ensure tax compliance at an international level.
The collection and reporting of data is a regulatory obligation that also applies to Greek financial institutions, pursuant to Council Directive.
If someone has an account or investment products in a country that has adopted the CRS and is a resident of another country that has also adopted the CRS, the financial institution of the former country is under the obligation to report information to its local tax authority. The local tax authority then forwards this information to the tax authority of the country of residency.
For more information concerning the requirements of the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), the customer may visit the OECD websites on the Automatic Exchange of Information or the website of the Independent Authority for Public Revenue, or consult his/her tax adviser.
https://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/
Example: If a customer has created a personal account in Viva Wallet and he/she has Swedish citizenship, then he/she is obliged to CRS and will be asked to upload (KYC proofs) the corresponding form either during the identification process or in the future.
In case the customer asks for further information regarding the forms that he/she should fill in, for example which he/she should fill or which fields he/she must fill, we should guide him to contact their tax advisor / accountant, the AADE or the local tax authority.

Steps to Complete Account's Verification Process
A. Accept Terms and Conditions & Provide E-Signature
Upon selecting the Electronic ID Proof, customer is asked to read and Accept Electronic ID’s terms and conditions (Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy).

By clicking accept, the Document to be signed will be displayed to the customer.
User only has to use the Accept Button.

It has been reported that on Safari on iOS devices, the document might not be displayed properly. However, the Accept button works properly.

B. Check Requirements screen & Document Upload
User should ensure that access to device’s camera and microphone has been enabled, or is not blocked by default on the browser’s settings.

Once the settings have been configured, customer is asked to choose the document that he/she wishes to use. The drop down list with the eligible ID documents may differ in each country.  
The country that should be selected, must be the country where the business operates. 

At the next step, the system informs the user on the requirements to successfully go through the Video ID Process.

C. Unassisted Video process 
Depending on the selected document, user is asked to follow the instructions and:

a. Show the front side of the selected document
b. Show the back side of the selected document
c. Smile at the Camera

Upon the completion of the Video ID process, user is asked to insert his/her phone number in order to receive and submit the OTP Password. 
Customer will be encouraged to use the mobile phone used for the registration to Viva Wallet.
